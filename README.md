# Energy_box_survey_app

Local community environmental group (Summerston Community Environmental Group, SCEG) wanted the 'energy boxes' in the local area surveying, so I created an app to upload photos of them and catalogue into a database for presentation to the local council to highlight the issue.

This is currently just the upload app, still to come are the collation and presentation pages. 

The app won't run on Posit cloud because it needs to use HEIC images to obtain GPS coordinate data and I can't find any way to get Posit to accept them. If anyone knows, or can point me to a cloud environment to run the app, please let me know.
