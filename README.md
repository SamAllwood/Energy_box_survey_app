# Energy_box_survey_app

Local community environmental group (Summerston Community Environmental Group, SCEG) wanted the 'energy boxes' in the local area surveying, so I created an app to upload photos of them and catalogue into a database for presentation to the local council to highlight the issue.

This is currently just the upload app, still to come are the collation and presentation pages.
